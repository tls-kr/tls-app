    <h3>Use of AI output in the TLS database</h3>
<p>
For the convenience of fellow students of classical Chinese we have provided the following books with line-by-line  (一讀一行) renderings of output produced by generative AI systems in TLS. <span class="ai" title="Translation generated by AI">All such AI 'translations' are marked with a light pinkish background to make it clear to the user that this is a mechanical output of an imperfect AI app that is still very much under development.</span> We do not call this output translations, a term we reverse for products of a human mind.  Everybody can see that this needs to be consulted and compared with <b>extreme care</b> and <b>critical alertness</b>. </p>
      <p>When so used, AI output will be found helpful in research and even in advanced teaching. Critical comparison with the leading translations by sinologists East and West is particularly sobering and rewarding.  The AI output invites a critical conversation between human and machine translation. 
</p>
    <p>
In this way TLS is all set to enable advanced analytic and scientific use of some technological facilities offered by the best of modern AI technology.   So far, I have found Google Gemini best among its competitors in translating from classical Chinese. Others may follow. And it is hoped that everybody will feel encouraged to add his own faourite AI translations into the database.
